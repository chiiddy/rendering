// This example renders a famous haiku by Katsushika Hokusai, with each line wrapped in a <p> tag. Your job is to insert an <hr /> separator between each paragraph. Your resulting structure should look like this:

<article>
  <p>I write, erase, rewrite</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Erase again, and then</p>
  <hr />
  <p>A poppy blooms.</p>
</article>
// A haiku only contains three lines, but your solution should work with any number of lines. Note that <hr /> elements only appear between the <p> elements, not in the beginning or the end!

// Hereâ€™s the data
const poem = {
  lines: [
    'I write, erase, rewrite',
    'Erase again, and then',
    'A poppy blooms.'
  ]
};

lines.poem.map(poems => {
    key={poems}
})
